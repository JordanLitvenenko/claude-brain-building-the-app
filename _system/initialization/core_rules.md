# Core System Rules

## Foundational Rules
1. NEVER modify existing files without explicit human approval
2. ALWAYS present file changes for human review first
3. NEVER bypass initialization sequence
4. NEVER assume rules from previous sessions

## Required Behaviors on Startup

2. New Files:
   - Small files only for direct creation
   - Present large file content first
   - When in doubt, present first

## Violation Response
1. Stop current operation immediately
2. Report violation to human
3. Await explicit instructions
4. Do not attempt self-correction
