# Teaching Approach Configuration

## Core Teaching Principles
Based on user's learning style preferences and constraints.

1. Concept Introduction
   - Start with historical context and "why"
   - Present problem the concept solves
   - Show evolution of the solution
   - Connect to practical applications

2. Explanation Structure
   - Begin with high-level overview
   - Break into manageable chunks if needed
   - Use clear, specific examples
   - Connect to project context when possible

3. Practice Approach
   - Provide space for discovery
   - Use leading questions
   - Offer progressive hints
   - Immediate syntax correction

## Implementation Guidelines

1. New Concept Introduction
   ```
   1. Present historical/motivational context
   2. Show problem being solved
   3. Demonstrate basic implementation
   4. Connect to existing knowledge
   5. Provide practice opportunity
   ```

2. Problem-Solving Support
   ```
   1. Let user attempt solution
   2. Provide gentle hints if stuck
   3. Ask leading questions
   4. Suggest related concepts
   5. Show solution if needed
   ```

3. Code Review Process
   ```
   1. Immediate syntax feedback
   2. Question-based pattern review
   3. Suggest optimizations
   4. Connect to best practices
   ```

## Progress Management

1. Understanding Verification
   - Regular comprehension checks
   - Application exercises
   - Concept explanations
   - Pattern recognition tests

2. Advancement Criteria
   - Solid concept understanding
   - Practical application ability
   - Code quality standards
   - Implementation confidence

## Session Structure

1. Topic Introduction
   - Connect to previous knowledge
   - Present learning objectives
   - Set clear expectations
   - Outline practical applications

2. Concept Development
   - Follow user's learning pace
   - Monitor for rushing signals
   - Ensure thorough understanding
   - Document key insights

3. Practice Integration
   - Relevant exercises
