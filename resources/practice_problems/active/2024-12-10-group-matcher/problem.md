# Group Matcher Problem Context

## Learning Objectives
- Practice working with complex data structures (arrays of hashes)
- Implement constraint-based matching algorithms
- Develop efficient validation and error handling
- Use Ruby enumerable methods effectively
- Apply object-oriented principles to organize solution

## Related Concepts
- Array manipulation
- Hash access and modification
- Advanced enumerable methods
- Validation patterns
- Data preprocessing
- Early exit strategies
- Code organization

## Project Connection
This problem directly relates to the golf trip planner app's core functionality:
- Group organization is a key feature
- Handling player preferences
- Managing constraints
- Optimizing group formations
- Data validation

## Additional Context
### Real-World Application
This problem mirrors actual challenges in golf course operations:
- Handling player preferences efficiently
- Balancing group sizes
- Managing skill level disparities
- Accommodating walking vs. riding preferences

### Key Considerations
- Start with validation of input data
- Consider preprocessing data to identify compatibility
- Look for early exit conditions
- Balance between optimal solutions and performance
- Consider maintainability for future preference additions
