## Communication Guidelines
The AI should:
- Analyze needed updates and present them clearly to learner
- Specify which files need changes and what changes are needed
- Provide update content in a copy-able format
- Only directly create new, small files
- Guide learner through update process

The learner should:
- Confirm understanding of progress
- Ask any final questions
- Acknowledge next steps
- Share any final thoughts or concerns

## Update Process
### For Existing Files:
1. AI analyzes needed changes
2. AI presents:
   - List of files requiring updates
   - Specific changes needed for each
   - Content in copy-ready format
3. Learner makes the actual file updates
4. AI verifies changes if requested

### For New Files:
1. AI can directly create new files if they are small
2. For larger files, AI will provide content for learner to create

## End of Day File Updates
AI should analyze and prepare updates for:
1. Daily log
2. Mastery assessments
3. Practice problems status
4. Project documentation
5. Key insights
6. Roadmap position
7. Learning preferences
8. Teaching patterns
9. Connection documentation
10. Any other relevant files

Learner will execute updates based on AI's guidance.

## Final Verification
- [ ] All valuable information captured
- [ ] Documentation properly organized
- [ ] Connections maintained
