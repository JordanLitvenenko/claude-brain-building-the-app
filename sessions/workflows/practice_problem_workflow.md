# Practice Problem Workflow

## Creating New Problems

### Directory Setup
```bash
resources/practice_problems/active/YYYY-MM-DD-problem-name/
```

### Required Files
1. requirements.md - Primary problem description
2. problem.md - Context and learning objectives
3. attempt.rb - Working solution
4. test_data.rb - Test cases
5. notes.md - Progress tracking

### Presentation Flow
1. Create complete directory structure
2. Initialize all files
3. Present requirements.md content
4. Reference other files as needed

## Problem Solving Process
1. Review requirements.md
2. Document approach in notes.md
3. Implement solution in attempt.rb
4. Test against test_data.rb
5. Track progress in notes.md

## Solution Verification
1. Verify solution meets all requirements
2. Run all test cases
3. Review code quality
4. Document learnings

## Problem Completion
1. Move directory to solved/
2. Rename attempt.rb to solution.rb
3. Convert notes.md to learnings.md
4. Update progress tracking
