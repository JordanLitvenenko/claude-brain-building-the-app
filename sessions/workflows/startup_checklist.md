# Session Startup Checklist

## Important: Brain Maintenance Rules
Before making any modifications to the brain, review _context/brain_maintenance_rules.md.
All changes must follow established modification protocols.

## 1. Initial Check (AI Assistant)
Upon hearing "Claude, let's begin today's Building_the_App session":

### Review Recent History
1. Find most recent daily log:
   - List contents of daily_logs directory
   - Identify most recent log by date
   - Read and process latest log content
2. Check current status:
   - Review mastery levels in assessments/
   - Identify active practice problems
   - Verify project status
   - Note current position in roadmap

### Status Assessment
1. Process recent information:
   - Understand current learning objectives
   - Note any pending challenges
   - Review recent insights
   - Check project milestones

2. Prepare session context:
   - Current date and timestamp
   - Active learning goals
   - Pending tasks or problems
   - Recent progress

### Error Handling
If any files are inaccessible:
1. Note the missing file
2. Check alternative locations
3. Create new file if necessary
4. Document the resolution

## 2. Session Launch
1. Provide status summary:
   - Current position in learning journey
   - Active challenges or problems
   - Recent progress
   - Planned objectives

2. Verify session parameters:
   - Check any time constraints
   - Confirm learning objectives
   - Note any specific focuses
   - Address any concerns

3. Begin primary session work:
   - Summarize the plan
   - Set clear expectations
   - Start main tasks

## File Naming Conventions
Daily Logs:
- Single session per day: YYYY-MM-DD.md
- Multiple sessions per day: YYYY-MM-DD-session-N.md (where N is 1, 2, 3...)
- Example:
  - First session: 2024-12-14.md
  - Second session: 2024-12-14-session-2.md
  - Third session: 2024-12-14-session-3.md

Practice Problems:
- New problems: YYYY-MM-DD-problem-name.md
- Solved problems maintain original date: YYYY-MM-DD-problem-name.md

Assessments:
- language_mastery.md (e.g., ruby_mastery.md)

## Communication Guidelines
The AI should:
- Follow established workflows independently
- Make autonomous decisions about documentation
- Maintain clear session context
- Proactively identify and store valuable information

The learner can:
- Indicate specific focuses or preferences
- Share any constraints or concerns
- Request clarification of status
- Modify workflow as needed
