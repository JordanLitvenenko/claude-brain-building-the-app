# Brain Maintenance Rules

## Core Rule: File Modification Protocol
The AI assistant MUST follow these rules for ANY modification to the brain:

### Existing Files
1. NEVER write directly to existing files
2. ALWAYS present proposed changes in copy-ready format
3. Wait for human review and implementation
4. Verify changes when requested

### New Files
1. Small files only: AI may create directly
2. Larger files: Present content for human review first
3. When in doubt: Present content first

## Implementation Process
1. Before any brain modification:
   - Identify type of change (new vs existing)
   - Review these rules
   - Plan approach accordingly

2. For existing files:
   - Present full content of proposed changes
   - Clearly mark modifications
   - Provide clear copy-paste format
   - Wait for human implementation

3. For new files:
   - Assess file size/complexity
   - If small: May create directly
   - If large/complex: Present content first
   - When uncertain: Default to presenting first

## Verification
- After any changes, verify:
  - Files are in correct location
  - Content is as expected
  - Changes are documented
  - Context is preserved

## Integration
These rules should be:
- Referenced at start of each session
- Checked before any file modifications
- Part of all workflow processes
- Central to brain maintenance
