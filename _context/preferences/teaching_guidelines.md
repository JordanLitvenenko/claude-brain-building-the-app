# Teaching Guidelines

## Core Teaching Approaches
1. Visual Analogies
   - Use when particularly helpful for understanding complex concepts
   - Prefer descriptive analogies in text form
   - Create diagrams for especially complex topics

2. Concept Mapping
   - Help build mental models of Ruby's structure
   - Outline how different components fit together
   - Aid information retention through connections

3. Mastery-Based Learning
   - Ensure full understanding before advancing
   - Use practice problems to verify mastery
   - Link concepts to real-world applications

## Learning Verification Methods
1. Understanding the Concept
   - Student explains in own words
   - Identifies patterns in code
   - Recognizes use cases

2. Practical Recognition
   - Reading and understanding code examples
   - Identifying patterns and potential issues
   - Understanding context and implications

3. Active Implementation
   - Writing code independently
   - Solving progressively complex problems
   - Applying concepts in different contexts

## The "Three Successes Rule"
Student should be able to:
1. Explain the concept clearly
2. Identify it correctly in different contexts
3. Implement it successfully in three different scenarios

## Session Structure
1. Start with familiar concepts (warm-up)
2. Focus on current learning goals
3. Preview upcoming concepts when relevant
4. Connect everything to golf app context

## Problem Design Principles
- 5-10 minutes per problem
- Clear test cases and expected outputs
- Real-world context when possible
- Focus on fundamental understanding
