- Learns syntax naturally after understanding purpose
- Willing to delay progress for deeper understanding

### Pattern Recognition Preferences
- Appreciates seeing data in tabular/visual formats
- Values understanding data relationships clearly
- Looks for optimization opportunities early
- Enjoys finding patterns in complex data

### Problem-Solving Approach
- Prefers identifying quick validation/failure points
- Values clear separation of data and logic
- Appreciates preprocessing data when beneficial
- Looks for reusable patterns and relationships

### Visual Learning Elements
- Benefits from spreadsheet-style data organization
- Values seeing relationships mapped out
- Appreciates visual representation of data structures
- Uses visual tools to understand complex relationships

### Mastery Mindset
- Prefers to fully master current concepts before advancing
- Comfortable revisiting and rewriting code for better understanding
- Values quality over speed in learning progression
- Willing to practice basics extensively

### Practice Approach
- Values hands-on coding practice
- Prefers problems that combine multiple concepts
- Comfortable with longer (30-60 minute) complex problems
- Appreciates seeing professional patterns in practice

## Teaching Preferences
### Explanation Style
- Start with high-level concept overview
- Break down into components when needed
- Appreciates detailed explanations without excess
- Values understanding practical applications

### Code Examples
- Prefers examples tied to golf app context
- Appreciates seeing professional implementations
- Values seeing multiple approaches to problems
- Learns from comparing different solutions

### Analogies and Models
- Responds well to practical analogies (e.g., factory machines)
- Values real-world comparisons (e.g., API endpoints)
- Appreciates business/operational analogies
- Benefits from connecting concepts to familiar domains

### Error Handling
- Prefers immediate correction for syntax errors
- Values space to discover logical errors
- Appreciates understanding why errors occur
- Learns from debugging process

## Session Structure
### Time Management
- Focuses best in 4-6 hour sessions
- Prefers deep dives into topics
- Tracks focused study time precisely
- Takes breaks when needed

### Progress Tracking
